Let's say "foo" is initially assigned a value of 0.

In myFunctionCall(++foo), the value of foo is incremented by 1 and stored back in the variable.
So it will be 1. While in myFunctionCall(foo++), the original value of foo is remembered, 
incremented by 1, and the original value of foo is returned. So, you have 0 as 
the parameter to myFunctionCall.

However, standalone, ++foo and foo++ are the same.
