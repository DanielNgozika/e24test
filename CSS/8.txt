Flexbox is my preferred layout system. It makes it easy to distribute content in a container
and specify the relationship between them. Thus, creating responsive websites and web apps is
a lot easier than when using floats.

It is easily my favourite CSS addition in CSS3.

Another option is CSS Grids, but I find myself using Flexbox more often.
