The CSS !important is used to add more specificity to a style rule. Where applied, 
it overrides other style rules for that specific CSS property on that specific element.

The only way to override an !important rule is to add the !important rule to a declaration
with the same or higher specificity.

It can be very useful when you're using a UI library and want to add some custom styling. 
Otherwise, it should be used sparingly. and wisely.
